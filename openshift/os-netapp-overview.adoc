NetApp integrates with Red Hat OpenShift using the Trident Storage Orchestrator to provide persistent storage for containerized applications. Supported storage options include ONTAP-based systems such as AFF and FAS, and ONTAP Select and Cloud Volumes ONTAP for virtualized and cloud environments. Cloud-native services like Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP, Azure NetApp Files, and Google Cloud NetApp Volumes are also supported.

* AFF and FAS systems run NetApp ONTAP and provide storage for both file-based (NFS) and block-based (iSCSI) use cases.

* Cloud Volumes ONTAP and ONTAP Select provide the same benefits in the cloud and virtual space respectively.

* Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP, Azure NetApp Files, and Google Cloud NetApp Volumes provide file-based storage in the cloud.

* NetApp Element storage systems provide for block-based (iSCSI) use cases in a highly scalable environment.


NOTE: Each storage system in the NetApp portfolio can ease both data management and movement between on-premises sites and the cloud, ensuring that your data is where your applications are.
