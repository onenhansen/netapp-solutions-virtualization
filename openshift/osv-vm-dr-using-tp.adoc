[.lead]
Set up disaster recovery for VMs in OpenShift Virtualization using Trident Protect. This procedure includes creating an AppVault with ONTAP S3, establishing AppMirror relationships between source and disaster recovery namespaces, scheduling replication, and executing failover and failback operations to maintain VM availability during site outages.

== Prerequisites
*   Trident must be installed. Backend and storage classes must be created before OpenShift Virtualization is installed on the cluster using the OpenShift Virtualization operator. 

*   Trident protect must be installed to implement failover and failback operations for the OpenShift VMs. Refer to the instructions here to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-protect/trident-protect-installation.html[install trident protect]

A VM must be available in OpenShift Virtualization. For details about deploying a new VM, or migrating an existing VM into OpenShift Virtualization, see the appropriate section in the documentation.

== Create App Vault using ONTAP S3

This section shows how to set up an app vault in trident protect using ontap S3 Object  storage.

Use oc commands and the yaml files shown below to create a secret and the appvault custom resource for ontap s3. Ensure that you create them in the trident protect namespace. 

[source, cli]
oc create -f app-vault-secret.yaml -n trident-protect
oc create -f app-vault.yaml -n trident-protect

[source,yaml]
apiVersion: v1
# You can provide the keys either as stringData or base 64 encoded data
stringData:
  accessKeyID: "<access key id as obtained from ONTAP>"
  secretAccessKey: "<secret access key as obtained from ONTAP>"
#data:
  #accessKeyID: <base 64 encoded value of access key>
  #secretAccessKey: <base 64 encoded value of secret access key>
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: appvault-secret
  namespace: trident-protect
type: Opaque

[source,yaml]
apiVersion: protect.trident.netapp.io/v1
kind: AppVault
metadata:
  name: ontap-s3-appvault
  namespace: trident-protect
spec:
  providerConfig:
    azure:
      accountName: ""
      bucketName: ""
      endpoint: ""
    gcp:
      bucketName: ""
      projectID: ""
    s3:
      bucketName: trident-protect
      endpoint: <data lif to use to access S3>
      secure: "false"
      skipCertValidation: "true"
  providerCredentials:
    accessKeyID:
      valueFromSecret:
        key: accessKeyID
        name: appvault-secret
    secretAccessKey:
      valueFromSecret:
        key: secretAccessKey
        name: appvault-secret
  providerType: OntapS3

Ensure that ontap S3 vault is created and is in the Available state

== Create a Trident protect app for the VM

Create an app custom resource in the namespace where the VM is located. 

image:redhat-openshift-ocpv-tp-004.png[OCP-v app in source-ns namespace]

[source,CLI]
tridentctl-protect create app source-vm -n source-ns --namespaces source-ns

image:redhat-openshift-ocpv-tp-004.png[OCP-v app in source-ns namespace]

== Create a Trident protect app for the Disaster Recovery VM in a new namespace

[source,CLI]
oc create ns dr-ns
tridentctl-protect create app dr-vm -n dr-ns --namespaces dr-ns

image:redhat-openshift-ocpv-tp-005.png[OCP-v app in source-ns namespace]

== Create an AppMirror Schedule in the source namespace

Create a schedule for  AppMirror using the yaml as shown. This will create snapshots using the schedule (every 5 minutes)  and retain 2 snapshots

[source,CLI]
oc create -f appmirror-schedule.yaml -n source-ns

[source,yaml]
apiVersion: protect.trident.netapp.io/v1
kind: Schedule
metadata:
  name: appmirror-sched1
spec:
  appVaultRef: ontap-s3-appvault
  applicationRef: source-vm
  backupRetention: "0"
  enabled: true
  granularity: Custom
  recurrenceRule: |-
    DTSTART:20240901T000200Z
    RRULE:FREQ=MINUTELY;INTERVAL=5
  snapshotRetention: "2"

image:redhat-openshift-ocpv-tp-006.png[App mirror Schedule source-ns namespace]

image:redhat-openshift-ocpv-tp-007.png[Snapshot created]

== Create an appMirror relationship in the DR namespace

Create an Appmirror relationship in the Disaster Recovery namespace. Set the desiredState to Established.

[source,yaml]
apiVersion: protect.trident.netapp.io/v1
kind: AppMirrorRelationship
metadata:
  name: amr1
spec:
  desiredState: Established
  destinationAppVaultRef: ontap-s3-appvault
  destinationApplicationRef: dr-vm
  namespaceMapping:
  - destination: dr-ns
    source: source-ns
  recurrenceRule: |-
    DTSTART:20240901T000200Z
    RRULE:FREQ=MINUTELY;INTERVAL=5
  sourceAppVaultRef: ontap-s3-appvault
  sourceApplicationName: source-vm
  sourceApplicationUID: "<application UID of the source VM>"
  storageClassName: "ontap-nas"

NOTE: You can get the application UID of the source VM from the json output of the source app as shown below

image:redhat-openshift-ocpv-tp-008.png[App UID created]

image:redhat-openshift-ocpv-tp-009.png[Create App Mirror relationship]

When the AppMirror relationship is established, the most recent snapshot is transferred to the destination namespace. The PVC is created for the VM in the dr namespace, however, the VM pod is not yet created in the dr namespace.

image:redhat-openshift-ocpv-tp-011.png[State changes for App mirror]

image:redhat-openshift-ocpv-tp-012.png[PVC is created in the destination namespace]

== Promote the relationship to Failover
Change the desired state of the relationship to "Promoted" to create the VM in the DR namespace. The VM is still running in the source namespace.

[source,CLI]
oc patch amr amr1 -n dr-ns --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"desiredState":"Promoted"}}'

image:redhat-openshift-ocpv-tp-013.png[AppMirror relationship apply patch]

image:redhat-openshift-ocpv-tp-014.png[AppMirror relationship is in Promoted State]

image:redhat-openshift-ocpv-tp-015.png[VM created in the DR namespace]

image:redhat-openshift-ocpv-tp-016.png[VM in source ns still running]

== Establish the relationship again to Failback
Change the desired state of the relationship to "Established". The VM is deleted in the DR namespace. The pvc still exists in the DR namespace. The VM is still running in the source namespace. The original relationship from source namespace to DR ns is established. . 

[source,CLI]
oc patch amr amr1 -n dr-ns --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"desiredState":"Established"}}'

image:redhat-openshift-ocpv-tp-017.png[Patch to Established State]

image:redhat-openshift-ocpv-tp-018.png[App Mirror in Established State]
