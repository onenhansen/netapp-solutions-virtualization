VMware vSphere administrators can enhance their infrastructure by migrating workloads to NetApp ONTAP datastores. ONTAP delivers VM-aware snapshots, storage-efficient clones, and seamless vMotion operations while supporting Storage Policy-Based Management (SPBM). Whether migrating from vSAN, legacy storage, or implementing hybrid cloud deployments, ONTAP provides improved performance and simplified storage operations for VMware environments.
