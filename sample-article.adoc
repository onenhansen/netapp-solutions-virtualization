Use this template for articles, topics, whatever you call them. The index.adoc file does not have the correct keywords for an article page and using it as a template can cause publishing problems later on. 

NOTE: Delete this file before initial publishing, as the file will be published even if it's not linked to the sidebar. After you create a few articles you can use them as a starter instead. 

If your articles will be in a content sub-folder, you will need to make two adjustments to the notation shown above:

* `:imagesdir:../media/`
* `permalink: folder-name/sample-article.html`
